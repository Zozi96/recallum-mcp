# Configuring MCP Clients (Codex and Claude Code)

Recallum speaks MCP over Streamable HTTP at `https://<host>/mcp/`. Every client
needs its own API key (issued with `recallum-admin issue-key`). Keys are per
user; never share one between people.

## Codex

`~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.recallum]
url = "https://recallum.example.com/mcp/"
bearer_token = "rcl_YOUR_API_KEY"
```

From the VPS itself, the same endpoint works over the public HTTPS route
(Traefik); no special local configuration is needed — local and remote clients
use the same URL and behavior.

## Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http recallum https://recallum.example.com/mcp/ \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer rcl_YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Verify:

```bash
claude mcp list            # recallum should be connected
```

## Agent usage guidance

Put a short instruction in each project's AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md so agents
remember to use the memory tools:

```md
You have persistent memory via the recallum MCP server.
- remember: store durable preferences, decisions, constraints, facts (atomic statements only).
- recall: search memory by meaning or exact terms before asking again.
- context: call at the start of a session on a project.
- update: when a stored fact changes, replace it instead of forgetting and
  re-adding; remember reports similar existing memories in its `similar` field,
  so read those and decide whether the new one supersedes them.
- list_memories / forget: browse and remove your own memories.
Never store full conversations; store the distilled fact.
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
|---|---|
| Tool call fails with "authentication required" | Missing `Authorization: Bearer` header |
| Tool call fails with "invalid or revoked API key" | Key typo or revoked — issue a new one |
| `recall` returns `mode: degraded_textual` | Ollama unreachable; check `readyz` and the ollama service |
| Client times out | MCP endpoint is `/mcp/` (trailing slash); HTTPS only via Traefik |
